# Python Coding: 100 Days of Code & Future Projects

## Resources:
For my initial studies in Python, I utilized the self-learning course by Dr. Angela Yu off of Udemy. This is, in her own words, the same cirriculum as her in-person Python bootcamp. Projects I've completed for this online version of the bootcamp will be uploaded to this repository under the folder labeled "Python\100DaysOfCode".
