# Python Coding: 100 Days of Code & Future Projects

## Resources:
For my initial studies in Python, I utilized the self-learning course by [Dr. Angela Yu off of Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). This is, in her own words, the same cirriculum as her in-person Python bootcamp. Projects I've completed for this online version of the bootcamp will be uploaded to my [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/jsparksbusiness95/100DaysOfCode) repository.

## IDE:
As per my instructor, I'm utilizing PyCharm for this project along with her coursework. I've configured it so that my project materials are synched not only to github, but also among my personal cloud storage devices.
